## Known Bugs
None. Everything was fixed before deployment.

## Reflections
Tic Tac Toe was the second most toughest project I had done. It involved alot of intricate details and alot more problem solving as compared to the Library and Calculator project. But, after thorough communication and asking well thought-out questions with the Odin Project community, I was able to complete the Tic Tac Toe project which involves the code being structured by following Factory Functions and the Revealing Module Pattern.
